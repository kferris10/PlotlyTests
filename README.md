# Testing Plotly
Testing the `plotly` package for Google Summer of Code.

## Easy Test
A comparison of wood water content in trees at two different locations (LEF and BZN) at high and low altitudes.  These data are simulated.  [Result](https://plot.ly/~kevin10/42/h-h-l/)

The original image:
![ggplot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kferris10/PlotlyTests/master/trees-ggplot.png "A Fancy Title")


## Medium Test
Next, instead using `ggplot` to construct the image, I made a list in R of the relevant attributes.  This list was used to create the [plotly graph](https://plot.ly/~kevin10/32/h-h-l/)

## Hard Test
See the `test-hard.R` code for my unit test.
